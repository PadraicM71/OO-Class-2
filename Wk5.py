# print(greeting) # Prints: Welcome John Doe! Injects the variable

# Dates
# by default we dont have any methods or functions for dates
# there is a date type for the variable - but dont have a constructor for them(lecture Mikhail)
# so we import:
import datetime #The module works off of classes that you can use to create objects,
#to create a simple date object you just need to provide 3 attributes â€“ 
# a year (int), a month (int), and day (int)
# lots of modules in Python itself - this one is included with Python distrubition already

# appolo_11_launch = datetime.date(1959, 9, 13)
# falcon_9_first_launch = datetime.date(2010, 6, 4)
# print(falcon_9_first_launch > appolo_11_launch) # prints: True
# print(falcon_9_first_launch.month)

# import datetime # lots of other features to this will do later

# appolo_11_launch = datetime.date(1959, 9, 13)
# print(appolo_11_launch.year) # prints: 1959
# appolo_11_launch.month # Prints: 9
# appolo_11_launch.day # Prints: 13

# import datetime # without the import it wont know what we want to acheive
# #because cannot reach that class
# current_datetime = datetime.date.today() # Returns datetime object of todays date
# print(current_datetime)
